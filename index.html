<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>I am interested in programming and risk management. This is because I love to find shortcuts and make things easier. Using programming I can make things easier for myself and others. This can make every day tasks more efficient for people allowing them to have more free time.  My interest in IT started from a very young age.  My friends had a major impact on my interest in IT. I first became involved in gaming on Xbox and my primary schools friends then introduced me to games on the computer. As we were always playing computer games, we had to solve any issues that came along. These issues consisted of files being corrupted, games not working, or computer freezing.  So we had to learn how to fix these problems so that we could continue to play. As I spent most of my time online and on computers, I slowly developed an interest in IT and programming. This allowed me to help friends and family when they had problems with their devices.  I have gotten most of my IT experience in my classes in secondary school.  These classes have been Programming, General IT and System Engineering.</p>
<p>I decided to come to RMIT as it has an outstanding reputation for IT. Universities like Deakin and Monash do produce students of a high standard however RMIT seems to be more technological based. It also offers the courses that I need to allow me to work in Cyber Security. I could complete the Bachelor of IT and then complete a Masters of Cyber Security. If I find that Cyber Security is not the area I want to work in, I can find another career pathway to another career in IT. </p>
<p>In my studies at RMIT I want to learn more about IT in general. I want to have a basic understanding of core topics in the IT field to help me find a career.  I believe that I want to work in the field of programming and security. In completing the core topics, I may find that there are other areas of IT that I enjoy more.  I can then change career paths into another area of IT.</p>

<h3>Ideal Job</h3>

<p>The role that is offered requires me to be able to provide advice and oversight on risk management. I would need to be able to assess and make recommendations about the technological risk in products, processes and business ideas. I would need to be able to lead the cyber security team in a variety of tasks to help the business. An example of this is where I would lead the review over introduction and use of the management framework. Moreover, this role would require me to help coach and develop a team which would allow them to enhance their technical and soft skills. This job Is appealing to me as it is a very important role that is needed within a business.  It allows me to make decisions to better help protect the business. It is also appealing as it lets me help other people develop skills that they may not have or need help developing. </p>
<p>There are many skills or qualifications that people need before they can apply for this role. Commonwealth Bank is looking for people who have certain skills.  They want individuals who can benefit the business. Some of these skills that are needed relate to past experience “like a proven understanding of IT service management and key controls” or “successfully leading, coaching and developing high performance teams of technology risk professionals”. These skills indicate to the company that you have had experience in leading a team and can benefit the business. Some skills that are needed would be a certification in the information technology field. If I have both these skills and experience, I can prove to the business that I am a “big thinker” and can fit right into their business.</p>
<p>The skills that I possess right now is coding from school year 10-12 and university. I do not have any certificates in the IT industry which means I would need to do a few extra courses towards the end of my degree to obtain these certificates. I would then gain work experience so I can be considered for this position. My experience of being a captain of a basketball and football team and a crew trainer at McDonalds Restaurant would show that I have some experience in leading people to a goal that needs to be achieved. </p>

<h3>Test Scores</h3>

<p>These tests indicate how efficiently I could work within a business. One of my skills is that I am observant, a thinker and I am an explorer. So I would be able to explore different problems and think of different solutions for a business.  I also like to constantly improve so I would be useful to the organisation as I would seek to constantly improve my skills.  Although I am an introvert, I would be listening, looking and thinking about the tasks I have to so. These tests show me that I’m a auditory learner and am good at listening.</p>

<h3>Project Idea</h3>
<p>The project that will be completed is an aim 1v1 game. This will allow people to verse their friends and compare aim.  It will also allow them to practice certain parts of their game if they want to improve. The game will have multiple modes which you can select and each will represent a type of game setting; one mode will be for people who play first person shooters, and another mode will be for people who play in third person. The player can choose from different weapons which will put their aim to the test. There will also be a online mode which will show who has the best aim in their respective parts.  This will have a leader board to encourage people to improve. </p>
<p>Although there are many aim trainer games that show who is the best aimer, they are often too confusing and have many leaders’ boards as they focus on individual aspects of aiming.  These games do not let people use the new skills in games, and are only useful for delveoping muscles memory. Having them train and also be able to compete against other players can help show that they have put their training to use. This will be used mostly by people who want to improve their aiming. It can help games who can’t/don’t have aim duels as the game will be able to mimic how the game is played so its just an external aim duel.</p>
<p>To start the game off the most important thing when it comes to an aiming game is the sensitivity of the mouse. That would be the target goal, I would like the game to be able to recognise the aiming multiplier of each different game. This would allow the user to choose the game and it will use that aim multiplier. Like a drop-down menu that will allow the user to search the game. This can then save them the trouble of trying to find a sensitivity multiplier which is never always accurate, ruining the whole point of the aim duel or aim trainer. The players need a type of map that they can challenge their friends at. The goal is to have at least 5 maps that the players can choose from. The map will be covered in high ground, low ground and boxes. Before the player joins the map, they can choose the weapon that they would like to use, every round they can have a chance to change their gun. When one player loses this is done by losing their health, the round ends. Another important aspect is having the player to choose the type of game that the aim duel will represent. This decides if the weapons accuracy changes by running/jumping or if the player needs to be viewed in a third person. This is because different games allow a different amount of running/jumping accuracy. For example, call of duty can allow you to run and jump which wont effect accuracy. However, a game like Counter strike global offensive requires you to be stationary. Like counter strike global offensive, Valorant is the same however it has a different period of break where you need to be stationary to have an accurate shot. Having multiple game settings will help the player perform to the best of their ability. Another feature is the aim training for people who want to improve their aim. This will consist of the player shooting AI that is scattered randomly in a select section in front of them. This helps them build muscle memory for aiming. Having a multiplayer game mode not only allows the player to aim duel their friends they can also test their aim against the rest of the region. This will be done by having a ranking system in online gameplay. It will be set to first to 10 rounds first player to those 10 rounds win. If the losing player, loses by a great margin of rounds, they will lose more ranked points. However, if the player loses by a fewer margin of rounds they will not lose as much ranked points. The ranked system will help to show who the best aimer is. The person who has the highest number of ranked points, will be classed the best aimer in that game mode. The player will be able to chose from a range of skins that they can look at whilst playing. These skins will be on their weapons as a vanity item, this will be one of the ways that the game will make money.</p>
<p>The tools required to make a game would either be Anvilnext or unreal engine. They are both known for making first person shooter games or third person shooters. Unreal engine was used in Fortnite and PUBG, whilst Anvilnext was used in making Rainbow Six siege. These are all very popular games that have had a successful career. I would also need a computer with enough space and processing power to create the game and refine it until it can be used on lower ended computers. This will let people who cannot afford a Computer with expensive parts to still be able to use the clients. </p>
<p>The skills that would be needed would be an advance knowledge of how to use Unreal engine or AnvilNext. An aim duel may be easy to create but importing aspects from different kind if games will take high level knowledge on the task. These skills can be found through a person who uses the client a lot or I can make plenty of games to gain the skills to be able to create the game. Some programming may be involved to allow the game to determine which game rules will be followed. Like the weapons that the player chooses, maps, trainers, etc. </p>
<p>If the project is successful in its creation, people will be able to challenge their friends to see who has the better aim. After the game is created or whilst its nearing completion it will need to be advertised. The advertising will be the next challenge after the game is released. This is because the game may not as earn as much money as its aimed to be a free game. Skins for characters and weapons can be introduced to attempt gain money to pay for the advertisement. However, there is no guarantee that people would pay for the skins which would leave the team/me down in money. </p>
